# 🏁 Contest

Welcome to the **Contest** repository!  
This repository contains solutions to competitive programming problems I’ve solved during various online contests on platforms like [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/wr.wasi_) and [VJudge](https://vjudge.net/user/1004_Wasi).

## 📌 About

## 🛠️ Languages Used

Most solutions are written in:

- C++
- C
- Python (occasionally)

## 🗂️ Structure

Solutions are organized by contest platform and contest name or number.
